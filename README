# hidden-data-extractor

Server side scripts to extract data that is embedded in web pages as javascript variables or JSON. 

There are two main pages, the index.php page that you hand a url

index.php?url=http://www.marksandspencer.com/textured-circle-lace-skater-dress/p/p22380707

This page provides a list of all the variables. From here you can use the getData.php to call that url and append "&variable=variable" in order to extract just that data in JSON format e.g.

getData.php?url=http://www.marksandspencer.com/textured-circle-lace-skater-dress/p/p22380707&variable=itemStockDetailsMap_3365010

An example is contained in test.html

As i've used a fashion site in the example it is likely that this example will stop working when this item is no longer fashionable. 

## Requirements:

PHP-CLI 5.0+ 
PhantomJS - http://phantomjs.org/

Once installed add the paths to config.php
